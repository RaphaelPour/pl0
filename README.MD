#PL/0 Compiler

This Python-based Compiler converts PL/0 source code into CL/0 virtual machine code. Both are educational languages with the aim to get faster to the real handwork of compiler-construction.

## PL0-Features

PL/0 provides a bunch of features such as:
* For-Loop
* While-Loop



## Bugs

* [ ] Conditional Statement error on wrong condition. The jmpnot jumps probably to the wrong address
* [ ] Call doesn't work properly. Check out BL5/BL6
* [x] Procedure can't access variables of the main programm
* [ ] Beck chooses main scope over local scope
